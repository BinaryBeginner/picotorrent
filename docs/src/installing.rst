Installing
==========

You should only install PicoTorrent from trusted sources. New releases are
published on GitHub and FossHub.


Download missing dependencies
-----------------------------

The installer gives you the option to download missing dependencies. If you
want to install the dependencies manually at a later date, you can uncheck
this option.

It can also be used to proceed with installation even though no internet
connection is present. In that case you would need to install the missing
dependencies manually as well.

The dependency being *Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable* which
can be downloaded from Microsoft.
